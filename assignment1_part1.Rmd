### Task 1. 

![Image of a snowshoe Image source: National Geographic](81736.jpg)

Snowshoe hares have been identified as a 'keystone' prey species in northern boreal forests. This study, conducted in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest just east of Fairbanks, Alaska, tracks snowshoe hare populations to generate quantitative data that could be used to better explain vegetation and preditor responses to fluctuations in hare populations. Snowshoe hares are known to experience population fluctuations every 8-11 years, as demonstrated by fluctuations in observation counts during the monitoring period. Counts of hare observations declined between 1999 and 2002, and then showed a steady increase from 2002 to 2010 (Figure 1.). 


Make sure that both your figure and table appear in your final knitted document, each with a useful caption. **Include text associated with each to help the audience understand and interpret the results.**
